## Getting Started
Users can utilize any common internet browser with Javascript enabled to access the Fluffr site.

- To get started, users can go to the landing page of the site and click 'Get Started'. 
- From there, new users and users who are not signed in will be taken to a sign in/sign up page.
- New users can then sign up with an email address, username, and password, or returning users can sign in with their email and password.
- Once the user is signed up or signed in, they will be taken to the home page where the real fun begins: They can begin swiping right for pets they want to learn more about, or left for those they do not.
- Users can see their right-swiped furry friends by clicking on the User icon, where their 'yes'-es are stored.

## About
